# disposition_gate.sh — deterministic STRUCTURAL gate for the disposition-aware merge gate (#137, slice #138).
#
# Validates the PR-local disposition state (a JSON file `wf.sh` manages OUTSIDE the committed tree — canonical
# copy is the PR comment, cache via `git rev-parse --git-path`; NOT a committed `.aar-ci/` file) against the
# reviewer's finding list. Runs BEFORE the model reviewer and is FAIL-CLOSED: any error, malformed file, or
# missing/!valid entry for a HIGH finding -> BLOCK, never PASS. It checks STRUCTURE only (completeness +
# well-formedness, incl. a required non-empty `description`). Whether a disposition is *sound* (does the fix
# fix, does the refutation refute, is the deferral legitimate) is the model reviewer's job (#139).
#
# Usage:  disposition_gate.sh <dispositions.json> <findings-file>
#   <findings-file>: one finding per line, "<ID> <SEVERITY>" (SEVERITY in HIGH|MED|LOW).
# Output: "DISPOSITION-GATE: PASS" (exit 0) or "DISPOSITION-GATE: BLOCK <reason>" (exit 2).
#
# Disposition statuses: fixed | refuted | deferred_out_of_scope | unresolved
